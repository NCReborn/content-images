<details><summary>▫️Installation Guide</summary>
  
🔹Welcome to the install guide for this collection.

**IMPORTANT** - We highly recommend you update to the latest version of Expedition 33 and make sure you have [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files) installed.

**IMPORTANT**  - Our collections are only compatible with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files)

**DISCLAIMER** - Our collections will only work on legitimate copies of the game, purchased through Steam/GoG/Epic stores. Any cracked/illegal copies will not be supported, and you will receive no help diagnosing issues if you have an illegitimate copy, so please don't waste our support teams time if it's not working on a non-legit copy of the game.

🔹**Vortex Settings**

\- In Settings, go to the Mods section and make sure the Deployment Method is set to Hardlink Deployment. Note: If you encounter issues selecting this option, it might be due to your drive format (e.g., FAT or XFAT). You may need to reformat the drive to a compatible format for hard links.&#x20;

Note: You must also have the location of your staging folder to be in the exact drive your game is installed on, So if your game is installed on your C: drive, then your staging folder must also be on the C: drive for hardlinked to work.

 🔹**Download the collection**

From our main Nexus page click on add collection, this will open up [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files) and begin the installation process. (Make sure to select the latest revision to stay up-to-date with the latest working mods)

 🔹**Vortex: Select profile to install**

Inside of vortex it will now bring a pop-up asking what profile you want to install the collection to. By default this is set to create a new profile (Recommended by Curator), keep this setting as it is and click "Install Now", It may also ask if you wish to switch to that profile, just click yes. (Also make sure "Install mods during collection download" is green/ticked.

 🔹**Vortex: Installing mods**

Vortex will now install the mods, if you are a premium users it may only take a couple minutes, if you are a free user, you will have to open each mod page individually and select to add each one to vortex. (If the collection has a small amount of mods this won't take too much longer)

During installation you may run into popups asking which .pak files you wish to install. I should (might forget) have a little popup that appears in the bottom right of vortex with instructions. Just select the options you wish to enable.

 🔹**Vortex: Collection Installed/Optional Mods**

Once the mods have been installed you should get the following pop-up, if any optional mods are present in the revision you are downloading you will be prompted to refuse them, or install them. If you don't want any of the optional mods select "No Thanks", if you wish to add the optional mods click "Install optional mods". Again I should have instructions for each optional mod added and what they change/alter. If you wish to not install it simply skip.

***Note: Please read through each optional mod instructions carefully, as some might make the game easier/harder.***

 🔹**Vortex: Collection Installed/Boot Game**

Congrats, the collection should now be installed correctly, simply deploy the mods, and click the play button at the top of vortex to boot into the game.

<details><summary>▫️Are Mod working?</summary>
The easiest way to tell if mods are working is to confirm you have no splash screens when loading the game. You should see several seconds of the flower screen shown (approx 10-60 Seconds depending on specs)

<details><summary>▫️Can I alter the collection?</summary>
While we don't recommend you modify the collection yourself, if you find mods are causing crashes feel free to report them in [discord ⁠🦠┃bugs and issues ](https://discord.com/channels/1285796904160202752/1285796905640788030)channel to find a solution, if a solution cannot be found feel free to disable problematic mods, but do bear in mind this could potentially introduce conflicts and issues with other mods that might depend on other mods. So only do so if absolutely necessary. We always advice letting the collection pack creators know so they can update the collection in future revisions.
</details>

<details><summary>▫️Will updating revisions affect my save?</summary>
This is highly unlikely, most mods are cosmetic and only add features to improve gameplay experience, they are unlikely to tamper with the fundamentals of the game, or affect saves. Best practice would be to make sure you know what save file you are on before an update. Then if you do run into issues with a new revision you can revert back to a previous revision and save file.\

I try my best to do extensive testing when adding/removing mods, and will always forwarn if a new save game is required.
